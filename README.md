# NFTs and the advantages/disadvantages of using them
In this document, I discuss two articles about the use of NFTs. The articles share opposing views and each present the benefits or disadvantages.

## NFT Uses For Business Settings

_NFT Uses For Business Settings_ introduces NFTs and defines them as "uniqure cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated." Or more simply put, they are "digital assests." The article explains that there are many misconceptions about NFTs which has led to the general population to not trust them. The reason for this mistrust is that NFTs are a novelty and a lot of people do not understood exctly what they are, and on top of that, the news has presented numerous headlines about "NFT scams, frauds, exchange issues, rug pulls." However, the article states that NFTs are actually good for business and with some financial education, people should come around and trust them more. 

NFTs are impacting many industries "for the better"; industries such as "gaming, ticketing, music, art, real estate, voting and government documentation." Usually, purchases made in games do not actually belong to the costumers. However, with NFTs, those purchases will actually belong to them. As for businesses, they can use NFTs for "memberships to programs, tickets to events, access to special events and even rewards programs." Clearly optimisitic about the future of NFTs, Starbucks, a major coffee chain, launched a platform on the Polygon chain. Despite the distrust for NFTs right now, the article is on the side of NFTs and believes that more people should, and will, come around when they can understand them better.

## Think cryptocurrency is bad? NFTs are even worse.

Contrary to _NFTS Uses For Business_, _Think cryptocurrency is bad? NFTs are even worse._ is not for NFTS and presents evidence for why they should not be used. According to the article, crytocurrency in general is bad for the environment. For example, Bitcoin mining produces “37 million tonnes of CO2 every year”, and NFTs are much worse for the environment. The carbon footprint they generate is "on par with that of entire countries". And that is Bitcoin alone, with 
NFTs adding to that with an even bigger impact, the futute of the world's climate does not sound at all promising.

According to the article, buying NFTs does not give anyone exclusive use of the work, nor does it add any improvement to it. In fact, they are negatively impacting some of the artist who made the work. Images, art, and anything similarly shared on the internet is "easily taken, duplicated, and spread online". This leads to credit not being given to the original creator. There are even Twitter accounts, such as @tokenizedtweets, who will tokenize any tweet for anyone, as long as they are tagged in the tweet. Despite the claims that NFTs could be a good investment, it seems they are harming the environment and artists from which they tokenize from.
